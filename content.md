# Setup your TIL (Today I Learned) Blog

## Why?
Keeping a learning journal is extremely valuable for software developers, for many reasons:

- Writing about what you’re doing helps clarify and internalize it.
- The post serves as documentation for the code, for teammates and your future self.
- When you inevitably have to do the same task again six months or two years later, you’ve written a cheat sheet for yourself.
- It looks great to prospective employers, demonstrating both writing and technical ability, among other things.

We call these "TIL blogs" or "TILs" — short for "Today I Learned". It isn't meant to be a blog where you're publishing brand new ideas that no one has ever thought of before — instead, they're just notes to your future self. (But I do learn about a lot of new stuff by reading students' TIL blogs, even after all these years.)

Here are a few learning journals from past trainees:

- [Samuel Lubliner](https://dev.to/samuellubliner)
- [Josseph Downs](https://dev.to/jdowns525)
- [Aldo Portillo](https://dev.to/aldoportillo)
- [Anna Villarreal](https://dev.to/annavi11arrea1)
- [Felix Imbanga](https://dev.to/feelo31)
- [Kat Jarboe](https://dev.to/melo616)
- [Mary Webby](https://dev.to/marywebby)

You can find even more learning journals at [https://news.dpi.dev](https://news.dpi.dev). We're going to use [dev.to](https://dev.to) for our blogs, for now. (In the future you can consider building your own blog — that would be a good exercise.)

## How

### 1. Sign up for a [dev.to](https://dev.to) account.
I recommend signing in with GitHub so that you don't have to make up yet another password.

### 2. Start jotting down notes in your blog.
You can save posts as drafts if you're not ready to share them yet.

A great source of TIL blog posts are answers to questions you've asked and other discussions (your own or others). To really cement what you learned, re-write the answer to your question or discussion as a TIL post.

### 3. Keep track of everyone's TIL blogs on [news.dpi.dev](https://news.dpi.dev).
Someone else might have already written the answer to your question!

### 4. Get Started
Submit the URL of your learning journal. It will look something like "https://dev.to/demostudent18"

- Enter your `dev.to/username` profile URL:
- dev.to
  - Great job!
- any
  - Not quite. Make sure the URL looks like: `dev.to/username`
{: .free_text #til_url title="TIL URL" points="1" answer="1" }


<div class="alert alert-danger mt-2">


After you submit the URL here, return to Canvas and submit the URL again in the assignment "Submit your TIL blog URL".


An instructor will provide additional feedback on your submission there.
